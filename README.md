# Welcome to Zeyan's Git

## Hey there! I'm Zeyan, my name is Jorge and this is my GitHub repo

My GitHub account stores all the projects that I've done along all my school history.

I have studied (and I'm studying) in these schools:

* CBTis No.122 (Where I got my degree as Technical Programmer)
* Instituto Tecnologico de Chihuahua II (Where I'm studying Systems Engineering) 

Also I'm trying to implement personal projects.
I'm hoping to get new knowledges and improve my programming skills.

I've worked with programming languages such as the following ones:

* [✅]JavaScript
* [✅]Java
* [✅]C++
* [✅]Python
* [❎]PHP

With these programming languages I've been envolved
with multiple enviroments as web, desktop apps and mobile apps.

Currently I'm very interested in applications
with frameworks as:

* React
* React Native

But mostly I'm trying to create my own projects
using Stable Diffussion using Python. With these languages and skills am making my way to be a great dev.

Hope you get interested in my repositories!
