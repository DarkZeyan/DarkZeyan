Hey there! I'm Zeyan, my name is Jorge and this is my GitHub repo. My GitHub account has all my project that I've done along all my school history.
I'm hoping to get new knowledges and improve my programming skills. I've worked with programming languages such as Java, C++ and JavaScript. I have some web projects an also
a mobile app named Healthify which was my final project in one of my programming subjects.
